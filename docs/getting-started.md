# From an example to your own wiki

This walkthrough connects a local Codex CLI client to fictional project knowledge,
follows a claim to its source, and saves an edit you can inspect in Git. Everything
in the example is synthetic. You can also complete the browser steps without an
agent account.

## Start the example

Use Linux or macOS with Node 24.19+ and Git. These commands use public `main`, which
may be newer than the latest tagged release. For an exact released version, see
[releases](https://github.com/dispatchlabs-ai/agentic-wiki/releases).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dispatchlabs-ai/agentic-wiki.git
cd agentic-wiki
npm ci
npm run example
```

Keep this terminal running. Open <http://127.0.0.1:4317> on the same machine.
The server creates `.runtime/example`, a separate Git repository containing three
fictional articles, and imports the two bundled conversation snapshots. It enables
local editing and never pushes. Your example edits survive a restart.

## Follow a claim to its evidence

Open **Atlas Labs**. Its Current work section describes a two-week prototype with
Cedar Instruments, reviewed by Morgan Vale. Select **recorded decision** to reach
the original Codex answer at `line-8`. Return to the article and select **prototype
plan** to reach the pi answer at `line-5`, which names Morgan as the reviewer.
The article's **Sources** tab also links to these passages.

The distinction matters: the article is a maintained explanation; the trace is the
original record behind it. A citation gives you a way to check a claim, rather than
making the claim automatically true.

## Connect Codex CLI

Install and sign in to [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli) if you
want to use an agent. The wiki itself has no model requirement; Codex uses your
own account and its normal usage limits. Run the client on the same machine as
the example. A hosted client cannot reach your computer's loopback address.

In a second terminal, start Codex with a setting for this invocation only:

```sh
codex -c 'mcp_servers.agentic_wiki.url="http://127.0.0.1:4317/mcp"'
```

Use `/mcp` to inspect the connection. This uses regular MCP over Streamable HTTP;
no browser integration or WebMCP experimental flag is required. The command does
not add a permanent server to your user configuration. See the
[official MCP configuration reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp?surface=cli)
for persistent configuration and client approval settings.

Ask:

> Use the agentic_wiki tools to search for Atlas Labs and read its article. Follow
> its original conversation citations. What is the prototype duration, and who
> reviews it? Cite the source passage. Do not change any articles.

Expect **two weeks** and **Morgan Vale**, supported by the bundled pi source at
`/traces/1becc1c6b6aff33213fee188a377c98641a4d78146ebd6f0ea7b9e7720709ce7/?page=1#line-5`.
The wording of the answer can vary. The tool activity should include a search,
an article read, and a trace read; an answer from the article alone has not checked
the original evidence.

Then ask:

> Use wiki.preview to preview this Markdown without saving it:
> Tutorial note: Morgan reviews the two-week prototype.

### Compatibility checked

On September 11, 2026, Codex CLI **0.153.0** on Linux with Node **26.8.1** completed
MCP discovery, article search/read, trace reading, preview, and history reading
against the v0.2.2 engine with the example-isolation fix. The test used a
command-line MCP URL override as above. Its noninteractive save attempt was
blocked by client approval policy; an agent-driven save was not verified in that
run. The browser save below and the official MCP SDK's save/retry/conflict tests
are separately tested. Other clients and remote authentication setups need their
own checks; protocol support alone is not a compatibility claim.

## Save and inspect a revision

In the browser, return to Atlas Labs and choose **Edit article**. Keep the existing
text, append the tutorial note above, and enter **Record the tutorial review note**
as the change summary. Preview, then save.

Open **History** and compare the new revision with its predecessor. A fresh example
advances from revision 1 to 2; a previously edited example can have higher numbers.
The current article should contain the note and retain both original citations.
From the engine checkout, inspect the corresponding Git change:

```sh
git -C .runtime/example log -1 --oneline
git -C .runtime/example show HEAD -- wiki/atlas-labs.md
```

Stop the server with Ctrl-C, restart `npm run example`, and read the article again.
The saved note remains; `examples/wiki/atlas-labs.md` is unchanged.

An agent can also save through `wiki.save` when the server exposes it and the
client permits the call. It must first read the current revision, preserve the
existing article, and use a fresh operation ID. Do not blindly retry a conflict
with a new revision ID; reconcile the text. For an ambiguous save response, retry
the identical request with the same operation ID. See the
[save contract](api.md#save-an-article) for the request and receipt fields.

## Start a personal content repository

Stop the example. From the engine checkout, create a separate content repository.
Choose a new destination if `../my-wiki-content` already exists. Replace the Git
author values with your own before running these commands:

```sh
mkdir ../my-wiki-content
git -C ../my-wiki-content init -b main
git -C ../my-wiki-content config user.name "Your Name"
git -C ../my-wiki-content config user.email "you@example.com"
mkdir ../my-wiki-content/wiki
cat > ../my-wiki-content/wiki/welcome.md <<'MARKDOWN'
---
title: Welcome
description: The starting point for my project knowledge.
topic: Projects
---

This is my first article. Add a sourced explanation of a project here.
MARKDOWN
git -C ../my-wiki-content add wiki
git -C ../my-wiki-content commit -m "Add first article"
```

Start the engine with that repository and explicit read-only settings, without
inheriting an existing trace provider:

```sh
WIKI_REPO="$(cd ../my-wiki-content && pwd)" \
WIKI_TRACES= WIKI_EVIDENCE_URL= WIKI_WRITE=0 WIKI_PUSH=0 \
WIKI_DATABASE=:memory: WIKI_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:4317 PORT=4317 npm start
```

Read **Welcome** in the browser. Restart the agent with the same MCP URL and search
for Welcome. Read-only discovery omits `wiki.save`. To edit through the browser or
MCP, stop the server and rerun the command with `WIKI_WRITE=1`. Client permissions
still apply. Ordinary file edits appear only after you commit them; pause server
writing while making direct Git edits.

Back up the complete content repository, including `.git`. The index is disposable;
the Git history and operation receipts are not. See [content format](../README.md#content-format),
[trace import](traces.md), and [recovery](api.md#git-correctness-and-recovery) when needed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                   | Next step                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node:sqlite` cannot load | Check `node --version`; use a supported runtime (Node 24.19+).                                                                                 |
| `EADDRINUSE`              | Stop your other example, or run `PORT=4318 npm run example` and use port 4318 in both browser and MCP URL.                                     |
| `Invalid host`            | Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`, for the default example; clear an inherited `WIKI_ORIGIN` or use its exact configured host.                  |
| MCP cannot connect        | Keep the server running on the client's machine; check its URL ends with `/mcp` and inspect `/mcp` in Codex.                                   |
| Save tool is absent       | Normal instances are read-only unless `WIKI_WRITE=1`; reconnect the client after changing server settings.                                     |
| Save requires approval    | Approve through your client's normal interactive flow. A noninteractive client can reject writes; use the browser editor for this walkthrough. |
| Old example edits remain  | This is intentional. Startup preserves `.runtime/example`; it does not reset your work.                                                        |

For remote use, supply HTTPS and access control at a reverse proxy, including on
`/mcp`. Browser login cookies do not automatically authenticate an MCP client.
There is no built-in user authentication or OAuth server. Verify your chosen
client can satisfy the proxy's authentication before connecting private content.
Do not expose the editable example as a public demo. See [security](../SECURITY.md).

# Existing archive integration

Set `WIKI_EVIDENCE_URL` to an operator-controlled HTTP(S) service base ending in `/`.
It is mutually exclusive with `WIKI_TRACES`. The engine reads this service; it does
not import, rewrite, or index its original archive. Protect the service and engine
with the deployment's access controls. The service URL is configuration, never
selected by article content. Redirects and upstream cookie forwarding are disabled.

## Read-only provider contract

All routes below are relative to the configured base. Errors use HTTP 400, 404 or 503. JSON responses must be objects. A synthetic implementation is available in
`tests/evidence-fixture.mjs`.

- `health`: archive readiness metadata.
- `search?q=&limit=20&offset=0&harness=&machine=`: `{results, total, nextOffset}`.
  Results include `id`, `url`, `title`, `snippet`, `machine`, `harness`, and `start`.
  Conversation matches do not imply a precise event match. Keep original provenance
  when available. Query length is at most 300; limit is 1–100, offset 0–1000000.
- `catalog`: the same filters, returning `{items, total, nextOffset}`.
- `traces/:id?kind=dialogue&offset=0&limit=100&event=`: a conversation projection.
  IDs use `chat-` plus 24 hexadecimal digits. Include canonical `id`, title, harness,
  machine, start, kind, offset, limit, total, counts, previousOffset, nextOffset and
  messages. Each message has its original id, aliases, role, timestamp, text,
  snapshot, line, inherited/rolled_back flags and attachments where recorded.
  An event lookup selects its category and page and returns `eventFound`.
  Optional categories are tool, thinking, reasoning, context and analysis. Retain
  related histories, gaps, recovery notes and parent metadata without inventing events.
- `attachments/:asset`: `{attachment}` with name, url, kind, size, provenance,
  status (`available`, `not_captured`, `too_large` or unavailable), and optional
  captured_at, preview and preview_truncated fields.
- `assets/:asset`: original bytes; support Range, Content-Type, Content-Length,
  Content-Range and Accept-Ranges. Asset names are a SHA-256 plus a short extension.

The browser uses `/conversations/:id/`, `/files/:asset`, and `/media/:asset` on the
engine origin. Media is streamed; `?download=1` requests a download. Raster images
can display inline; PDFs open as files; text/Markdown previews remain inert and
explicitly report shortening or missing originals. Other formats download. HTML
and SVG are not executed. External images require an explicit open action.

## Search and citations

Search scopes are All, Articles and Traces. Article topic/state filters and trace
harness/machine filters remain independent. Initial HTML includes article results;
the browser requests trace results separately. Typing debounces for 180 ms and
cancels stale requests. Without JavaScript, submit with `sync=1` for both groups.
An unavailable trace service leaves articles usable and reports a visible error.
Scores from separate indexes are not merged into a single ranking. Attachment
text is not searched unless the operator's search service explicitly indexes it.

`wiki.traces`, `wiki.trace`, and `wiki.traceSearch` use the provider when configured.
`wiki.trace` supports `page` (one-based, default page size 100), `limit` (1–100),
`offset` (zero-based), `kind` and event lookup. If page and offset are both supplied,
they must identify the same starting point. An event lookup selects its own page.
The engine translates page numbers before calling the provider. External catalogs
use machine/harness filters and reject the imported-only `session_id` parameter.
`wiki.file` exposes safe file inspection and original/download URLs; `wiki.preview`
renders draft Markdown without writing. See [the API contract](api.md#webmcp-quotation-and-failure-contracts)
for verified quotations and structured WebMCP errors.
Provider mode omits imported-archive session, raw-line and logical-provenance tools.
Structured article evidence remains distinct, including multiple quotes from one
URL; source anchors and task state metadata are preserved. Existing conversation
fragments are resolved through event aliases, including events on later pages.
This adapter does not add ingestion, authentication, OCR or Office document rendering.

## Progressive disclosure

Default trace reads return only user prompts and assistant responses with original
text, source identities and attachment metadata. Tool calls/results, recorded
thinking/reasoning, context and analysis require an explicit category or cited
event request. `wiki.file` expands attachment content. The human conversation
reader explicitly requests `attachments=preview` for its embedded previews.

`after` and `before` accept ISO 8601 timestamps with a timezone. The interval is
inclusive at `after`, exclusive at `before`. Whole-conversation analysis rejects
time filters because its aggregate measurements are not event windows. Providers must filter before applying
page/offset/limit, echo the bounds, and reject invalid or reversed intervals.
Undated events are excluded only when a range is specified; `undatedCount` reports
the category's undated events so callers can request them without a range. An
event outside the range returns `eventFound: false` without changing that range.
Category counts disclose availability without returning optional event bodies.
Pagination must retain the range and page size. Event bodies are never summarized
or silently shortened. Original files remain accessible through explicit file reads.

For example, first call `wiki.trace` with `{id}`. Then request
`{id, kind: "tool", after: "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z", before: "2026-01-01T10:05:00Z"}`.
The same disclosure contract should be used by any future standalone MCP transport.

## Optional event text windows

Full event text is the default. Supply `textOffset` and/or `textLimit` only when
partial text is useful. These are nonnegative integers measured in Unicode code
points (combining marks count separately). Offset alone returns the remainder;
`textLimit=0` returns length metadata without text. Each message returns
`textWindow: {offset, returnedChars, totalChars, nextTextOffset, unit}` when a
window is requested. Use `nextTextOffset` explicitly to continue, or omit both
parameters to retrieve the full text. An offset at or beyond the end returns an
empty chunk and null continuation. No truncation or summarization is imposed.

Message pagination and time windows still select events; text windows select a
portion of each selected event. For a single event, use `event` (the original wiki
WebMCP tools name it `eventId`). External event aliases resolve to the canonical
event; chunked event lookups return only that event. Imported trace messages have
stable `line-N-part-P` ids to distinguish multiple parts of a mixed source record.
Keep the same event, category and time bounds when continuing. A missing event or
one outside the range returns no chunk. Aggregate analysis is not event text and
does not accept these parameters. Text windows affect message text, not attachment
content; original source records and captured files remain available separately.

Example: `{id, event: "<event-id>", textOffset: 0, textLimit: 4000}` followed by
the same request with `textOffset` set to the returned `nextTextOffset`.
